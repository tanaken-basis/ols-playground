## Overview

[![example of ols-playground](img/ols-playground_example_en.png)](https://tanaken-basis.github.io/ols-playground/)

This web app is a **learning tool for simple linear regression with Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)**.  
It allows you to interactively adjust a regression line and observe how it minimizes the **Sum of Squared Errors (SSE)**.

Check out the [example of program usage](https://tanaken-basis.github.io/ols-playground/) to see how it works.
